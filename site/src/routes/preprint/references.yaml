    The development of strategies for the design of novel materials is
    increasingly a knowledge-based activity and this book highlights a variety
    of experimental and computational methods that provide structural knowledge
    about individual compounds or groups of related compounds. However,
    scientific research and development is an evolutionary process in which the
    critical analysis and assessment of all existing information is an essential
    component. In the area of chemical structure, such analyses provide
    fundamental insights which can lead to the detection of trends and
    probabilities, and to the formulation of hypotheses and rules. These
    indications, in their turn, can direct the future course of structural
    design, synthesis and experiment.

    The rational solid-state synthesis of inorganic compounds is formulated as
    catalytic nucleation on crystalline reactants, where contributions of
    reaction and interfacial energies to the nucleation barriers are
    approximated from high-throughput thermochemical data and structural and
    interfacial features of crystals, respectively. Favorable synthesis
    reactions are then identified by a Pareto analysis of relative nucleation
    barriers and phase selectivities of reactions leading to the target. We
    demonstrate the application of this approach in reaction planning for the
    solid-state synthesis of a range of compounds, including the widely studied
    oxides LiCoO2, BaTiO3, and YBa2Cu3O7, as well as other metal oxide,
    oxyfluoride, phosphate, and nitride targets. Pathways for enabling the
    retrosynthesis of inorganics are also discussed.

    Machine learning has emerged as a novel tool for the efficient prediction of
    material properties, and claims have been made that machine-learned models
    for the formation energy of compounds can approach the accuracy of Density
    Functional Theory (DFT). The models tested in this work include five
    recently published compositional models, a baseline model using
    stoichiometry alone, and a structural model. By testing seven machine
    learning models for formation energy on stability predictions using the
    Materials Project database of DFT calculations for 85,014 unique chemical
    compositions, we show that while formation energies can indeed be predicted
    well, all compositional models perform poorly on predicting the stability of
    compounds, making them considerably less useful than DFT for the discovery
    and design of new solids. Most critically, in sparse chemical spaces where
    few stoichiometries have stable compounds, only the structural model is
    capable of efficiently detecting which materials are stable. The
    nonincremental improvement of structural models compared with compositional
    models is noteworthy and encourages the use of structural models for
    materials discovery, with the constraint that for any new composition, the
    ground-state structure is not known a priori. This work demonstrates that
    accurate predictions of formation energy do not imply accurate predictions
    of stability, emphasizing the importance of assessing model performance on
    stability predictions, for which we provide a set of publicly available
    tests.

    The success of first-principles electronic-structure calculation for
    predictive modeling in chemistry, solid-state physics, and materials science
    is constrained by the limitations on simulated length scales and timescales
    due to the computational cost and its scaling. Techniques based on
    machine-learning ideas for interpolating the Born-Oppenheimer potential
    energy surface without explicitly describing electrons have recently shown
    great promise, but accurately and efficiently fitting the physically
    relevant space of configurations remains a challenging goal. Here, we
    present a Gaussian approximation potential for silicon that achieves this
    milestone, accurately reproducing density-functional-theory reference
    results for a wide range of observable properties, including crystal,
    liquid, and amorphous bulk phases, as well as point, line, and plane
    defects. We demonstrate that this new potential enables calculations such as
    finite-temperature phase-boundary lines, self-diffusivity in the liquid,
    formation of the amorphous by slow quench, and dynamic brittle fracture, all
    of which are very expensive with a first-principles method. We show that the
    uncertainty quantification inherent to the Gaussian process regression
    framework gives a qualitative estimate of the potential’s accuracy for a
    given atomic configuration. The success of this model shows that it is
    indeed possible to create a useful machine-learning-based interatomic
    potential that comprehensively describes a material on the atomic scale and
    serves as a template for the development of such models in the future.

    The accurate description of chemical processes often requires the use of
    computationally demanding methods like density-functional theory (DFT),
    making long simulations of large systems unfeasible. In this Letter we
    introduce a new kind of neural-network representation of DFT
    potential-energy surfaces, which provides the energy and forces as a
    function of all atomic positions in systems of arbitrary size and is several
    orders of magnitude faster than DFT. The high accuracy of the method is
    demonstrated for bulk silicon and compared with empirical potentials and
    DFT. The method is general and can be applied to all types of periodic and
    nonperiodic systems.

    The predictive capabilities of machine learning (ML) models used in
    materials discovery are typically measured using simple statistics such as
    the root-mean-square error (RMSE) or the coefficient of determination
    ($r^2$) between ML-predicted materials property values and their known
    values. A tempting assumption is that models with low error should be
    effective at guiding materials discovery, and conversely, models with high
    error should give poor discovery performance. However, we observe that no
    clear connection exists between a "static" quantity averaged across an
    entire training set, such as RMSE, and an ML property model's ability to
    dynamically guide the iterative (and often extrapolative) discovery of novel
    materials with targeted properties. In this work, we simulate a sequential
    learning (SL)-guided materials discovery process and demonstrate a
    decoupling between traditional model error metrics and model performance in
    guiding materials discoveries. We show that model performance in materials
    discovery depends strongly on (1) the target range within the property
    distribution (e.g., whether a 1st or 10th decile material is desired); (2)
    the incorporation of uncertainty estimates in the SL acquisition function;
    (3) whether the scientist is interested in one discovery or many targets;
    and (4) how many SL iterations are allowed. To overcome the limitations of
    static metrics and robustly capture SL performance, we recommend metrics
    such as Discovery Yield ($DY$), a measure of how many high-performing
    materials were discovered during SL, and Discovery Probability ($DP$), a
    measure of likelihood of discovering high-performing materials at any point
    in the SL process.

    Catalyst discovery and optimization is key to solving many societal and
    energy challenges including solar fuel synthesis, long-term energy storage,
    and renewable fertilizer production. Despite considerable effort by the
    catalysis community to apply machine learning models to the computational
    catalyst discovery process, it remains an open challenge to build models
    that can generalize across both elemental compositions of surfaces and
    adsorbate identity/configurations, perhaps because datasets have been
    smaller in catalysis than in related fields. To address this, we developed
    the OC20 dataset, consisting of 1,281,040 density functional theory (DFT)
    relaxations (∼264,890,000 single-point evaluations) across a wide swath of
    materials, surfaces, and adsorbates (nitrogen, carbon, and oxygen
    chemistries). We supplemented this dataset with randomly perturbed
    structures, short timescale molecular dynamics, and electronic structure
    analyses. The dataset comprises three central tasks indicative of day-to-day
    catalyst modeling and comes with predefined train/validation/test splits to
    facilitate direct comparisons with future model development efforts. We
    applied three state-of-the-art graph neural network models (CGCNN, SchNet,
    and DimeNet++) to each of these tasks as baseline demonstrations for the
    community to build on. In almost every task, no upper limit on model size
    was identified, suggesting that even larger models are likely to improve on
    initial results. The dataset and baseline models are both provided as open
    resources as well as a public leader board to encourage community
    contributions to solve these important tasks.

    Graph networks are a new machine learning (ML) paradigm that supports both
    relational reasoning and combinatorial generalization. Here, we develop
    universal MatErials Graph Network (MEGNet) models for accurate property
    prediction in both molecules and crystals. We demonstrate that the MEGNet
    models outperform prior ML models such as the SchNet in 11 out of 13
    properties of the QM9 molecule data set. Similarly, we show that MEGNet
    models trained on ∼60 000 crystals in the Materials Project substantially
    outperform prior ML models in the prediction of the formation energies, band
    gaps, and elastic moduli of crystals, achieving better than density
    functional theory accuracy over a much larger data set. We present two new
    strategies to address data limitations common in materials science and
    chemistry. First, we demonstrate a physically intuitive approach to unify
    four separate molecular MEGNet models for the internal energy at 0 K and
    room temperature, enthalpy, and Gibbs free energy into a single free energy
    MEGNet model by incorporating the temperature, pressure, and entropy as
    global state inputs. Second, we show that the learned element embeddings in
    MEGNet models encode periodic chemical trends and can be transfer-learned
    from a property model trained on a larger data set (formation energies) to
    improve property models with smaller amounts of data (band gaps and elastic
    moduli).

    Interatomic potentials (IAPs), which describe the potential energy surface
    of atoms, are a fundamental input for atomistic simulations. However,
    existing IAPs are either fitted to narrow chemistries or too inaccurate for
    general applications. Here we report a universal IAP for materials based on
    graph neural networks with three-body interactions (M3GNet). The M3GNet IAP
    was trained on the massive database of structural relaxations performed by
    the Materials Project over the past ten years and has broad applications in
    structural relaxation, dynamic simulations and property prediction of
    materials across diverse chemical spaces. About 1.8 million materials from a
    screening of 31 million hypothetical crystal structures were identified to
    be potentially stable against existing Materials Project crystals based on
    M3GNet energies. Of the top 2,000 materials with the lowest energies above
    the convex hull, 1,578 were verified to be stable using density functional
    theory calculations. These results demonstrate a machine
    learning-accelerated pathway to the discovery of synthesizable materials
    with exceptional properties.

  abstract: "Forming a four-component compound from the first 103 elements of the periodic table results in more than 1012 combinations. Such a materials space is intractable to high-throughput experiment or first-principle computation. We\_introduce a framework to address this problem and quantify how many materials can exist. We apply principles of valency and electronegativity to filter chemically implausible compositions, which reduces the inorganic quaternary space to 1010 combinations. We demonstrate that estimates of band gaps and absolute electron energies can be made simply on the basis of the chemical composition and apply this to the search for new semiconducting materials to support the photoelectrochemical splitting of water. We show the applicability to predicting crystal structure by analogy with known compounds, including exploration of the phase space for ternary combinations that form a perovskite lattice. Computer screening reproduces known perovskite materials and predicts the feasibility of thousands more. Given the simplicity of the approach, large-scale searches can be performed on a single workstation."

    The simulation of large-scale systems with complex electron interactions
    remains one of the greatest challenges for the atomistic modeling of
    materials. Although classical force-fields often fail to describe the
    coupling between electronic states and ionic rearrangements, the more
    accurate \textit{ab-initio} molecular dynamics suffers from computational
    complexity that prevents long-time and large-scale simulations, which are
    essential to study many technologically relevant phenomena, such as
    reactions, ion migrations, phase transformations, and degradation. In this
    work, we present the Crystal Hamiltonian Graph neural Network (CHGNet) as a
    novel machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP), using a
    graph-neural-network-based force-field to model a universal potential energy
    surface. CHGNet is pretrained on the energies, forces, stresses, and
    magnetic moments from the Materials Project Trajectory Dataset, which
    consists of over 10 years of density functional theory static and relaxation
    trajectories of $\sim 1.5$ million inorganic structures. The explicit
    inclusion of magnetic moments enables CHGNet to learn and accurately
    represent the orbital occupancy of electrons, enhancing its capability to
    describe both atomic and electronic degrees of freedom. We demonstrate
    several applications of CHGNet in solid-state materials, including
    charge-informed molecular dynamics in Li$_x$MnO$_2$, the finite temperature
    phase diagram for Li$_x$FePO$_4$ and Li diffusion in garnet conductors. We
    critically analyze the significance of including charge information for
    capturing appropriate chemistry, and we provide new insights into ionic
    systems with additional electronic degrees of freedom that can not be
    observed by previous MLIPs.

    The explosion of image data on the Internet has the potential to foster more
    sophisticated and robust models and algorithms to index, retrieve, organize
    and interact with images and multimedia data. But exactly how such data can
    be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a
    new database called “ImageNet”, a large-scale ontology of images built upon
    the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the
    majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500–1000 clean
    and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of
    annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper
    offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees
    with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is
    much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current
    image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging
    task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk.
    Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple
    applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic
    object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and
    hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to
    researchers in the computer vision community and beyond.

    Elemental phosphorus is attracting growing interest across fundamental and
    applied fields of research. However, atomistic simulations of phosphorus
    have remained an outstanding challenge. Here, we show that a universally
    applicable force field for phosphorus can be created by machine learning
    (ML) from a suitably chosen ensemble of quantum-mechanical results. Our
    model is fitted to density-functional theory plus many-body dispersion
    (DFT + MBD) data; its accuracy is demonstrated for the exfoliation of black
    and violet phosphorus (yielding monolayers of “phosphorene” and
    “hittorfene”); its transferability is shown for the transition between the
    molecular and network liquid phases. An application to a phosphorene
    nanoribbon on an experimentally relevant length scale exemplifies the power
    of accurate and flexible ML-driven force fields for next-generation
    materials modelling. The methodology promises new insights into phosphorus
    as well as other structurally complex, e.g., layered solids that are
    relevant in diverse areas of chemistry, physics, and materials science.

    We present a benchmark test suite and an automated machine learning
    procedure for evaluating supervised machine learning (ML) models for
    predicting properties of inorganic bulk materials. The test suite, Matbench,
    is a set of 13 ML tasks that range in size from 312 to 132k samples and
    contain data from 10 density functional theory-derived and experimental
    sources. Tasks include predicting optical, thermal, electronic,
    thermodynamic, tensile, and elastic properties given a material’s
    composition and/or crystal structure. The reference algorithm, Automatminer,
    is a highly-extensible, fully automated ML pipeline for predicting materials
    properties from materials primitives (such as composition and crystal
    structure) without user intervention or hyperparameter tuning. We test
    Automatminer on the Matbench test suite and compare its predictive power
    with state-of-the-art crystal graph neural networks and a traditional
    descriptor-based Random Forest model. We find Automatminer achieves the best
    performance on 8 of 13 tasks in the benchmark. We also show our test suite
    is capable of exposing predictive advantages of each algorithm—namely, that
    crystal graph methods appear to outperform traditional machine learning
    methods given ~104 or greater data points. We encourage evaluating materials
    ML algorithms on the Matbench benchmark and comparing them against the
    latest version of Automatminer.

    Computational materials discovery has grown in utility over the past decade
    due to advances in computing power and crystal structure prediction
    algorithms (CSPA). However, the computational cost of the ab initio
    calculations required by CSPA limits its utility to small unit cells,
    reducing the compositional and structural space the algorithms can explore.
    Past studies have bypassed unneeded ab initio calculations by utilizing
    machine learning to predict the stability of a material. Specifically, graph
    neural networks trained on large datasets of relaxed structures display high
    fidelity in predicting formation energy. Unfortunately, the geometries of
    structures produced by CSPA deviate from the relaxed state, which leads to
    poor predictions, hindering the model’s ability to filter unstable material.
    To remedy this behavior, we propose a simple, physically motivated,
    computationally efficient perturbation technique that augments training
    data, improving predictions on unrelaxed structures by 66%. Finally, we show
    how this error reduction can accelerate CSPA.

  abstract: "Machine learning has the potential to accelerate materials discovery by accurately predicting materials properties at a low computational cost. However, the model inputs remain a key stumbling block. Current methods typically use descriptors constructed from knowledge of either the full crystal structure\_—\_therefore only applicable to materials with already characterised structures\_—\_or structure-agnostic fixed-length representations hand-engineered from the stoichiometry. We develop a machine learning approach that takes only the stoichiometry as input and automatically learns appropriate and systematically improvable descriptors from data. Our key insight is to treat the stoichiometric formula as a dense weighted graph between elements. Compared to the state of the art for structure-agnostic methods, our approach achieves lower errors with less data."

    The evaluation of reaction energies between solids using density functional
    theory (DFT) is of practical importance in many technological fields and
    paramount in the study of the phase stability of known and predicted
    compounds. In this work, we present a comparison between reaction energies
    provided by experiments and computed by DFT in the generalized gradient
    approximation (GGA), using a Hubbard U parameter for some transition metal
    elements (GGA+U). We use a data set of 135 reactions involving the formation
    of ternary oxides from binary oxides in a broad range of chemistries and
    crystal structures. We find that the computational errors can be modeled by
    a normal distribution with a mean close to zero and a standard deviation of
    24 meV/atom. The significantly smaller error compared to the more commonly
    reported errors in the formation energies from the elements is related to
    the larger cancellation of errors in energies when reactions involve
    chemically similar compounds. This result is of importance for phase diagram
    computations for which the relevant reaction energies are often not from the
    elements but from chemically close phases (e.g., ternary oxides versus
    binary oxides). In addition, we discuss the distribution of computational
    errors among chemistries and show that the use of a Hubbard U parameter is
    critical to the accuracy of reaction energies involving transition metals
    even when no major change in formal oxidation state is occurring.

    Accelerating the discovery of advanced materials is essential for human
    welfare and sustainable, clean energy. In this paper, we introduce the
    Materials Project (www.materialsproject.org), a core program of the
    Materials Genome Initiative that uses high-throughput computing to uncover
    the properties of all known inorganic materials. This open dataset can be
    accessed through multiple channels for both interactive exploration and data
    mining. The Materials Project also seeks to create open-source platforms for
    developing robust, sophisticated materials analyses. Future efforts will
    enable users to perform ‘‘rapid-prototyping’’ of new materials in silico,
    and provide researchers with new avenues for cost-effective, data-driven
    materials design.

    Accelerated inorganic synthesis remains a significant challenge in the
    search for novel, functional materials. Many of the principles which enable
    “synthesis by design” in synthetic organic chemistry do not exist in
    solid-state chemistry, despite the availability of extensive
    computed/experimental thermochemistry data. In this work, we present a
    chemical reaction network model for solid-state synthesis constructed from
    available thermochemistry data and devise a computationally tractable
    approach for suggesting likely reaction pathways via the application of
    pathfinding algorithms and linear combination of lowest-cost paths in the
    network. We demonstrate initial success of the network in predicting complex
    reaction pathways comparable to those reported in the literature for YMnO3,
    Y2Mn2O7, Fe2SiS4, and YBa2Cu3O6.5. The reaction network presents
    opportunities for enabling reaction pathway prediction, rapid iteration
    between experimental/theoretical results, and ultimately, control of the
    synthesis of solid-state materials.

    To realize renewable and sustainable energy cycle, there has been a lot of
    effort put into discovering catalysts with desired properties from a large
    chemical space. To achieve this goal, several screening strategies have been
    proposed, most of which require validation of thermodynamic stability and
    synthesizability of candidate materials via computationally intensive
    quantum chemistry or solid-state physics calculations. This problem can be
    overcome by reducing the number of calculations through machine learning
    methods, which predict target properties using unrelaxed crystal structures
    as inputs. However, numerical input representations of most of the previous
    models are based on either too specific (e.g., atomic coordinates) or too
    ambiguous (e.g., stoichiometry) information, practically inapplicable to
    energy prediction of unrelaxed initial structures. In this work, we develop
    direction-based crystal graph convolutional neural network (D-CGCNN) with
    the highest accuracy toward formation energy predictions of the relaxed
    structures using the initial structures as inputs. By comparing with other
    approaches, we revealed correlations between crystal graph similarities and
    model performances, elucidating the origin of the improved accuracy of our
    model. We applied this model to the on-going high-throughput virtual
    screening project, where the model discovered 1,725 stable materials from
    15,318 unrelaxed structures by performing 3,966 structure optimizations (~25
    %).

    The recently proposed crystal graph convolutional neural network (CGCNN)
    offers a highly versatile and accurate machine learning (ML) framework by
    learning material properties directly from graphlike representations of
    crystal structures (“crystal graphs”). Here, we develop an improved variant
    of the CGCNN model (iCGCNN) that outperforms the original by incorporating
    information of the Voronoi tessellated crystal structure, explicit
    three-body correlations of neighboring constituent atoms, and an optimized
    chemical representation of interatomic bonds in the crystal graphs. We
    demonstrate the accuracy of the improved framework in two distinct
    illustrations: First, when trained/validated on 180 000/20 000 density
    functional theory (DFT) calculated thermodynamic stability entries taken
    from the Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD) and evaluated on a separate
    test set of 230 000 entries, iCGCNN achieves a predictive accuracy that is
    significantly improved, i.e., 20% higher than that of the original CGCNN.
    Second, when used to assist a high-throughput search for materials in the
    ThCr2Si2 structure-type, iCGCNN exhibited a success rate of 31% which is 155
    times higher than an undirected high-throughput search and 2.4 times higher
    than that of the original CGCNN. Using both CGCNN and iCGCNN, we screened
    132 600 compounds with elemental decorations of the ThCr2Si2 prototype
    crystal structure and identified a total of 97 unique stable compounds by
    performing 757 DFT calculations, accelerating the computational time of the
    high-throughput search by a factor of 65. Our results suggest that the
    iCGCNN can be used to accelerate high-throughput discoveries of new
    materials by quickly and accurately identifying crystalline compounds with
    properties of interest.

    High-throughput density functional theory (HT DFT) is fast becoming a
    powerful tool for accelerating materials design and discovery by the
    amassing tens and even hundreds of thousands of DFT calculations in large
    databases. Complex materials problems can be approached much more
    efficiently and broadly through the sheer quantity of structures and
    chemistries available in such databases. Our HT DFT database, the Open
    Quantum Materials Database (OQMD), contains over 200,000 DFT calculated
    crystal structures and will be freely available for public use at
    http://oqmd.org. In this review, we describe the OQMD and its use in five
    materials problems, spanning a wide range of applications and materials
    types: (I) Li-air battery combination catalyst/electrodes, (II) Li-ion
    battery anodes, (III) Li-ion battery cathode coatings reactive with HF, (IV)
    Mg-alloy long-period stacking ordered (LPSO) strengthening precipitates, and
    (V) training a machine learning model to predict new stable ternary
    compounds.

    The development of machine learning models for electrocatalysts requires a
    broad set of training data to enable their use across a wide variety of
    materials. One class of materials that currently lacks sufficient training
    data is oxides, which are critical for the development of Oxygen Evolution
    Reaction (OER) catalysts. To address this, we developed the Open Catalyst
    2022 (OC22) dataset, consisting of 62,331 Density Functional Theory (DFT)
    relaxations (~9,854,504 single point calculations) across a range of oxide
    materials, coverages, and adsorbates. We define generalized total energy
    tasks that enable property prediction beyond adsorption energies; we test
    baseline performance of several graph neural networks; and we provide
    pre-defined dataset splits to establish clear benchmarks for future efforts.
    In the most general task, GemNet-OC sees a ~32% improvement in energy
    predictions when combining the chemically dissimilar Open Catalyst 2020
    Dataset (OC20) and OC22 datasets via fine-tuning. Similarly, we achieved a
    ~19% improvement in total energy predictions on OC20 and a ~9% improvement
    in force predictions in OC22 when using joint training. We demonstrate the
    practical utility of a top performing model by capturing literature
    adsorption energies and important OER scaling relationships. We expect OC22
    to provide an important benchmark for models seeking to incorporate
    intricate long-range electrostatic and magnetic interactions in oxide
    surfaces. The dataset and baseline models are open sourced, and a public
    leaderboard has been made available to encourage continued community
    developments on the total energy tasks and data.

    The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or
    convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best
    performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention
    mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer,
    based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and
    convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show
    these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and
    requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on
    the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing
    best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014
    English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model
    state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight
    GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the
    literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by
    applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and
    limited training data.

    We propose an efficient high-throughput scheme for the discovery of stable
    crystalline phases. Our approach is based on the transmutation of known
    compounds, through the substitution of atoms in the crystal structure with
    chemically similar ones. The concept of similarity is defined quantitatively
    using a measure of chemical replaceability, extracted by data-mining
    experimental databases. In this way we build 189,981 possible crystal
    phases, including 18,479 that are on the convex hull of stability. The
    resulting success rate of 9.72% is at least one order of magnitude better
    than the usual success rate of systematic high-throughput calculations for a
    specific family of materials, and comparable with speed-up factors of
    machine learning filtering procedures. As a characterization of the set of
    18,479 stable compounds, we calculate their electronic band gaps, magnetic
    moments, and hardness. Our approach, that can be used as a filter on top of
    any high-throughput scheme, enables us to efficiently extract stable
    compounds from tremendously large initial sets, without any initial
    assumption on their crystal structures or chemical compositions.

    A very active area of materials research is to devise methods that use
    machine learning to automatically extract predictive models from existing
    materials data. While prior examples have demonstrated successful models for
    some applications, many more applications exist where machine learning can
    make a strong impact. To enable faster development of machine-learning-based
    models for such applications, we have created a framework capable of being
    applied to a broad range of materials data. Our method works by using a
    chemically diverse list of attributes, which we demonstrate are suitable for
    describing a wide variety of properties, and a novel method for partitioning
    the data set into groups of similar materials to boost the predictive
    accuracy. In this manuscript, we demonstrate how this new method can be used
    to predict diverse properties of crystalline and amorphous materials, such
    as band gap energy and glass-forming ability.

    While high-throughput density functional theory (DFT) has become a prevalent
    tool for materials discovery, it is limited by the relatively large
    computational cost. In this paper, we explore using DFT data from
    high-throughput calculations to create faster, surrogate models with machine
    learning (ML) that can be used to guide new searches. Our method works by
    using decision tree models to map DFT-calculated formation enthalpies to a
    set of attributes consisting of two distinct types: (i)
    composition-dependent attributes of elemental properties (as have been used
    in previous ML models of DFT formation energies), combined with (ii)
    attributes derived from the Voronoi tessellation of the compound's crystal
    structure. The ML models created using this method have half the
    cross-validation error and similar training and evaluation speeds to models
    created with the Coulomb matrix and partial radial distribution function
    methods. For a dataset of 435 000 formation energies taken from the Open
    Quantum Materials Database (OQMD), our model achieves a mean absolute error
    of 80 meV/atom in cross validation, which is lower than the approximate
    error between DFT-computed and experimentally measured formation enthalpies
    and below 15% of the mean absolute deviation of the training set. We also
    demonstrate that our method can accurately estimate the formation energy of
    materials outside of the training set and be used to identify materials with
    especially large formation enthalpies. We propose that our models can be
    used to accelerate the discovery of new materials by identifying the most
    promising materials to study with DFT at little additional computational
    cost.

    Chemical reaction networks (CRNs), defined by sets of species and possible
    reactions between them, are widely used to interrogate chemical systems. To
    capture increasingly complex phenomena, CRNs can be leveraged alongside
    data-driven methods and machine learning (ML). In this Perspective, we
    assess the diverse strategies available for CRN construction and analysis in
    pursuit of a wide range of scientific goals, discuss ML techniques currently
    being applied to CRNs and outline future CRN-ML approaches, presenting
    scientific and technical challenges to overcome.

    The use of machine learning methods for accelerating the design of
    crystalline materials usually requires manually constructed feature vectors
    or complex transformation of atom coordinates to input the crystal
    structure, which either constrains the model to certain crystal types or
    makes it difficult to provide chemical insights. Here, we develop a crystal
    graph convolutional neural networks framework to directly learn material
    properties from the connection of atoms in the crystal, providing a
    universal and interpretable representation of crystalline materials. Our
    method provides a highly accurate prediction of density functional theory
    calculated properties for eight different properties of crystals with
    various structure types and compositions after being trained with 104 data
    points. Further, our framework is interpretable because one can extract the
    contributions from local chemical environments to global properties. Using
    an example of perovskites, we show how this information can be utilized to
    discover empirical rules for materials design.

    Machine learning (ML) models utilizing structure-based features provide an
    efficient means for accurate property predictions across diverse chemical
    spaces. However, obtaining equilibrium crystal structures typically requires
    expensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which limits
    ML-based exploration to either known crystals or a small number of
    hypothetical crystals. Here, we demonstrate that the application of Bayesian
    optimization with symmetry constraints using a graph deep learning energy
    model can be used to perform “DFT-free” relaxations of crystal structures.
    Using this approach to significantly improve the accuracy of ML-predicted
    formation energies and elastic moduli of hypothetical crystals, two novel
    ultra-incompressible hard MoWC2 (P63/mmc) and ReWB (Pca21) were identified
    and successfully synthesized via in situ reactive spark plasma sintering
    from screening 399,960 transition metal borides and carbides. This work
    addresses a critical bottleneck to accurate property predictions for
    hypothetical materials, paving the way to ML-accelerated discovery of new
    materials with exceptional properties.
