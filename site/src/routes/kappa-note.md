> ⚠️ We are working on extending Matbench Discovery to thermal conductivity prediction via modeling of anharmonic phonons.
> Both presentation and results are work in progress.
> A new more holistic metric combining F1 and κ<sub>SRME</sub>, the symmetric relative mean error in predicting thermal conductivity κ, is under development.
> Near-term efforts are focused on scaling up a secret test set from ~100 to ~1000 chemically and symmetrically diverse crystal structures to make overfitting on this new task harder.
> Because it tests the 2nd and 3rd order derivatives of the potential energy surface (PES) and higher derivatives expose even subtle discontinuities in the PES, we believe this to be a stricter and more robust metric for measuring both the utility of ML force fields and the physical accuracy of the PES encoded by an MLFF. It is also interesting because thermal conductivity measurements offer a direct path for benchmarking future MLFFs against experimental data, the highest quality ground truth.
> We invite early feedback on this benchmark extension via [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/janosh/matbench-discovery/discussions).

> The only difference between the procedure presented by [Póta](https://tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/profiles/bp443/), [Ahlawat](https://tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/profiles/pa483), [Csányi](https://eng.cam.ac.uk/profiles/gc121), and [Simoncelli](https://tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/profiles/ms2855), and the results shown here is the relaxation protocol has been updated and unified for all models.
> It is now a sequential cell relax followed by a site relax (changing atom positions only). Each relaxation stage has a maximum number of 300 steps with [`FrechetCellFilter`](https://gitlab.com/ase/ase/-/blob/e65782af/ase/filters.py#L495) and a force threshold of `fmax=1e-4` (eV/Å). To preserve crystal symmetry, unit-cell angles are not allowed to change. This unified protocol gives the same κ<sub>SRME</sub> reported in [arXiv:2408.00755](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00755) for all models except M3GNet which improves to a slightly lower error with the new procedure (1.469 → 1.412).
> The code to reproduce the full κ<sub>SRME</sub> evaluation on new models is published in https://github.com/MPA2suite/autoWTE.
>
> This is still WIP with near-term efforts focused on scaling up the test set from ~100 to ~1000 chemically and symmetrically diverse crystal structures to make overfitting on this new task harder (though we believe it is hard already).
