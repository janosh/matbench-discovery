  description: |
    SevenNet is a graph neural network interatomic potential package that supports parallel molecular dynamics simulations.
    In the SevenNet-0 model, based on the NequIP architecture, the tensor product in the self-connection layer, which includes numerous element-specific parameters, is replaced by a linear (or self-interaction) layer.
    SevenNet-0 features 5 interaction blocks with node features comprising irreducible representations of 128 scalars (l = 0), 64 vectors (l = 1), and 32 tensors (l = 2).
    The convolutional filter employs rc of 5 Ã…, and a tensor product of learnable radial functions from bases of 8 radial Bessel functions and spherical harmonics up to l = 2.
