notes:
  description: M3GNet is a GNN-based universal (as in full periodic table) interatomic potential for materials trained on up to 3-body interactions in the initial, middle and final frame of MP DFT relaxations.
  long: It thereby learns to emulate structure relaxation, MD simulations and property prediction of materials across diverse chemical spaces.
  training: Using pre-trained model released with paper. Was only trained on initial, middle and final frames of a subset of 62,783 MP relaxation trajectories in the 2018 database release (see [related issue](https://github.com/materialsvirtuallab/m3gnet/issues/20#issuecomment-1207087219)).
  testing: We also tried combining M3GNet with MEGNet where M3GNet is used to relax initial structures which are then passed to MEGNet to predict the formation energy.
