notes:
  Description: A random forest trained to map the combo of composition-based Magpie features and structure-based relaxation-invariant Voronoi tessellation features (bond angles, coordination numbers, ...) to DFT formation energies.
  Long: This is an old model that predates most deep learning for materials but significantly improved over Coulomb matrix and partial radial distribution function methods. It therefore serves as a good baseline model to see what modern ML buys us.
