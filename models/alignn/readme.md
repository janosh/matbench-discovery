## ALIGNN formation energy predictions on WBM test set

ALIGNN is trained using L1 loss and 1000 epochs. The model that performs best on the validation set is saved and used for predictions. This required minor changes to the ALIGNN source code provided in `alignn-2023.01.10.patch`

1. Fix use without test set (see [ALIGNN #104)](https://github.com/usnistgov/alignn/issues/104#issue-1723978225). In this case, we forked a test set, but it might be better to use the entire data, as mentioned above, especially if the test set by chance contains some important outliers.
1. The `Checkpoint` handler in ALIGNN does not define a score name (see [`train.py`](https://github.com/usnistgov/alignn/blob/46334500cac9833125b3e444d65d0246e692bd61/alignn/train.py#L851)), so it will just save the last two models during training. With this patch, also the best model in terms of accuracy on the validation set is saved, which is the one used to make predictions. This is important, because I used a relatively large `n_early_stopping` in case the validation accuracy shows a double descent (see [Figure 10](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.02292.pdf)).

The changes in `alignn-2023.01.10.patch` were applied to ALIGNN version `2023.01.10`.

To reproduce the `alignn` package state used for this submission, run

```bash
pip install alignn==2023.01.10
alignn_dir=$(python -c "import alignn; print(alignn.__path__[0])")
cd $alignn_dir
git apply /path/to/alignn-2023.01.10.patch
```

Replace `/path/to/` with the actual path to the patch file.

The directory contains the following files, which must be executed in the given order to reproduce the results:

1. `train_data.py`: Export Matbench Discovery training data to ALIGNN compatible format. This script outputs training data in the directory `data_train`. In addition, a small test data set is set apart and stored in the directory `data_test`
1. `train_alignn.py`: Train an ALIGNN model on previously exported data. The resulting model is stored in the directory `data-train-result`
1. `test_alignn.py`: Test a trained ALIGNN model on the WBM data. Generates `2023-06-03-mp-e-form-alignn-wbm-IS2RE.csv.gz`.
