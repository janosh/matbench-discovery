## ALIGNN formation energy predictions on WBM test set

ALIGNN was trained for 1000 epochs using L1 loss. The model that performed best on the validation set was [uploaded to Figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Matbench_Discovery_v1_0_0/22715158?file=41233560) as [`2023-06-02-pbenner-best-alignn-model.pth.zip`](https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/41233560) and used for predictions. This required minor changes to the ALIGNN source code provided in `alignn-2023.01.10.patch`

1. Fix use without test set (see [ALIGNN #104)](https://github.com/usnistgov/alignn/issues/104#issue-1723978225). In this case, we forked a test set, but it might be better to use the entire data, as mentioned above, especially if the test set by chance contains some important outliers.
1. The `Checkpoint` handler in ALIGNN does not define a score name (see [`train.py`](https://github.com/usnistgov/alignn/blob/46334500/alignn/train.py#L851)), so it will just save the last two models during training. With this patch, also the best model in terms of accuracy on the validation set is saved, which is the one used to make predictions. This is important because I used a relatively large `n_early_stopping` in case the validation accuracy shows a double descent (see [Figure 10](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.02292.pdf)).

The changes in `alignn-2023.01.10.patch` were applied to ALIGNN version [`2023.01.10`](https://pypi.org/project/alignn/2023.10.1).

To reproduce the `alignn` package state used for this submission, run

```bash
pip install alignn==2023.01.10
alignn_dir=$(python -c "import alignn; print(alignn.__path__[0])")
cd $alignn_dir
git apply /path/to/alignn-2023.01.10.patch
```

Replace `/path/to/` with the actual path to the patch file.

The directory contains the following files, which must be executed in the given order to reproduce the results:

1. [`train_alignn.py`](train_alignn.py): Train an ALIGNN model on all 154k MP computed structure entries. The resulting model checkpoint is saved to the `out_dir` variable in that script and also uploaded to `wandb` from where it is publicly available for 3rd party reproducibility.
1. [`test_alignn_discovery.py`](test_alignn_discovery.py): Test a trained ALIGNN model on the WBM data. Generated `2023-06-03-mp-e-form-alignn-wbm-IS2RE.csv.gz`.
