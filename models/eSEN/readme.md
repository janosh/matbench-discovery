# FAIRChem eSEN models

## Models

Two equivariant Smooth Energy Network (eSEN) models are submitted:

1. **eSEN-30M-MP** - A compliant model trained on MPTrj only
2. **eSEN-30M-OAM** - A non-compliant model pretrained with the OMat24 dataset and finetuned with MPTrj + sAlex

The code and training config is currently WIP and will be available in the coming weeks in the official [FAIRChem repo](https://github.com/FAIR-Chem/fairchem). The checkpoints will be made available in the official FAIRChem [HuggingFace site](https://huggingface.co/fairchem).

Additional information about eSEN can be found in our paper:
