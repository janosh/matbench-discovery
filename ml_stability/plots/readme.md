Plotting scripts in this folder were originally [sent by Rhys on Slack](https://ml-physics.slack.com/archives/DD8GBBRLN/p1654973643390109) on Jun 11, 2022 and later heavily modified.

They are needed to generate the classification histograms and moving MAE plots in the [Wren paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11132) and go together with the data files in `data/stability_plot_scripts`.
