They are needed to generate the classification histograms and moving MAE plots in the [Wren paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11132) and go together with the code in `mb_discovery/stability_plot_scripts`.

## Format WBM material IDs

To convert `step_1_0`, `step_1_1` into `wbm-step-1-1`, `wbm-step-1-2`, etc., see `increment_wbm_material_id` in `process_wbm_cleaned.py`.
